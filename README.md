# Companion AI Tutor

Companion AI Tutor is a learning-focused coding assistant designed for beginners.
Instead of generating full solutions, it guides learners through mistakes using
hints, questions, and explanations to strengthen problem-solving skills.

## Problem
Many beginners rely on AI tools to obtain complete code solutions, which limits
their understanding of programming logic and reduces independent thinking.

## Solution
This project provides a conversational AI tutor that analyzes user input, detects
common beginner mistakes, and responds with guided feedback rather than final code.

## Key Features
- Chat-style interface similar to ChatGPT
- Accepts both questions and code snippets
- Refuses to provide full corrected code
- Highlights common beginner errors (loops, indentation, output)
- Encourages step-by-step reasoning

## How to Run
1. Install Python
2. Run 'python app.py'
3. Open 'http://127.0.0.1:5000' in your browser

## Impact
The system promotes active learning and reduces over-dependence on generative AI
in early programming education.
